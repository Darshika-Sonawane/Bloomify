    <h1>How does air pollution affect plants?</h1><br><br>
    <p style="color: #666; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">More and more people realize that air pollution is dangerous for people and animals. However, not many know that it can damage plants as well. Would you like to learn how does pollution affect plants, vegetables and fruit? Keep reading to discover various types of air pollutants that influence plants adversely!</p>
    <br><br>
    <div class="title2"><h1>6 ways air pollution impacts plants</h1></div><br><br>
    <p style="color: #666; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">We can talk about plant pollution when substances and pollutants that aren’t naturally found in the environment and come from water, air, or soil are absorbed by plants. In this situation, they can affect fruit, vegetables, and trees in a number of ways:</p><br><br>
    <br>
    <h2>1. They damage leaves</h2><br>
    <p style="color: #666; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Ground-level ozone and other harmful pollutants we breathe in have a visible impact on plant leaves. They can cause chlorosis, or they may even turn leaves yellow, which decreases the concentration of chlorophyll. Consequently, the plant isn’t able to produce its own food or energy, and may even die.</p><br><br>
    <h2>2. They hinder flowering</h2><br>
    <p style="color: #666; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Plants exposed to pollution and smog usually flower and blossom later, as they’re stressed and use all the available resources to fight pollutants and survive. This can be observed when looking at flowers, trees, and other plants located near busy roads. Plants exposed to vehicle exhausts typically blossom much later.</p><br><br>
    <h2>3. They damage roots</h2><br>
    <p style="color: #666; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">If plants absorb pollutants or live in acidic soil, they may find it hard to survive. Acidic soil has lots of aluminium ions which damage roots and prevent the plant from taking vital ions and nutrients from it.</p><br><br>
    <h2>4. They damage stomata</h2><br>
    <p style="color: #666; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">You have never heard of this term? Well, stomata are small pores on leaves, and they serve as a tool for exchanging gases with the atmosphere. The more pollution in the immediate surrounding of the plant, the smaller the somata, which has a negative impact on the process of exchanging gases and hampers photosynthesis.</p><br><br>
    <h2>5. They prevent plants from growing</h2><br>
    <p style="color: #666; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Harmful chemical compounds like nitrogen oxides, ozone sulphur, and carbons can damage plants in a number of ways, including their stunted growth. How is it possible? Ozone creates holes in the atmosphere. As a result of it, ultraviolet light passes through the atmosphere and is able to destroy plants. This also prevents photosynthesis and plant growth.</p><br><br>
    <h2>6. They contribute to global warming</h2><br>
    <p style="color: #666; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Everybody knows that plants are able to absorb carbon dioxide. Unfortunately, the more the plants are damaged and affected by the air pollution, the less carbon dioxide they take in. Consequently, it goes into the atmosphere and destroys the ozone layer. This accelerates global warming and climate change.</p><br><br>
    <br>
    <hr style="border: 2.5px solid green;border-radius: 5px;"><br><br><br>
    <h2>What is Air Quality Index?</h2><br>
    <p style="color: #666; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">AQI is the air quality index; it gives you the index value that what is the current pollution status in the city, how polluted the air currently is.</p><br><br>
    <h2>How Is AQI Measured?</h2><br>
    <p style="color: #666; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Eight pollutants namely particulate matter (PM) 10, PM2.5, Ozone (O3), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), lead (Pb) and ammonia (NH3) act as major parameters in deriving the AQI of an area. Short-term (upto 24-hours and 8-hours for CO and O3) National Ambient Air Quality Standards are prescribed for these pollutants.</p><br><br>

    <br><br>
    <p style="color: #666; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">There are eight pollutants whose concentration is measured and then based on the ambient concentrations, corresponding standards and likely health impact, a sub-index is calculated for each of these pollutants. The worst sub-index determines the overall AQI for the city and the pollutant whose sub-index is the worst becomes the prominent pollutant.</p><br><br>

    <br><br><br><br><br>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">The takeaway - air pollution and plants</h2><br><br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Air pollution, including smog, has a tremendous impact not only on people and animals, but also on plants. Harmful substances such as ground-level ozone hinder photosynthesis, prevent trees and flowers from growing, and delay their blooming. Moreover, acid rains and pollutants that are absorbed by soil can damage roots of plants. Unfortunately, the more plants are destroyed, the quicker the climate change proceeds, so it’s important to take protective measures and plant new trees.  </p>
